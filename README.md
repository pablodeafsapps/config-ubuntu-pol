# config-ubuntu-pol

This project gathers several configuration files which allow to quickly set up certain popular features on Unix-based machines. The aim here is not development, but having a quick access configuration repository.

## Prerequisites

These files work under Unix-based distributions. In my case, Ubuntu.

## Usage

Simply clone this repo and copy the files of interest to the required locations.

## Content
So far, this repository includes configuration files for the following features:
* **Bash**. The `.bashrc` file is normally placed under the user directory (`~`). It comprises commands and alias to use the terminal. 
* **Vim**. The `.vimrc` file is normally places under the user directory (`~`). It relates the Vim editor, which is one of the most common and popular in the community.
* **i3**. This is a well known window manager which allows to speed up your work. It comes with two different status bar flavors: *i3Status* and *i3Blocks*. The content is normally placed in a folder called `i3`, under the user directory (`~`).
